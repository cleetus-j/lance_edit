This will someday work as a method to export-import map and other data for the SMS version of Heroes of the Lance, as the name might suggest.
What has code for now:
  -The unaltered ROM's items, traps, monsters and the characters items and details could be viewed.
I still have to code the "frame" for the application. Having code for something does not mean it can do it without anything additional code.Very much work in progress.
The game's map structure has to be analyzed.
